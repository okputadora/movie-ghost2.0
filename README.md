# Movie Ghost
## Summary
Movie Ghost is a mobile-first single-page-application built with
React and React-Router (bootstrapped with create-react-app)

## Rules of the game
* The user starts the game by entering the name of a movie.
* The next player then has to name an actor in that movie.
* And then the next player has to name a _different_ movie in which that actor appears.
* The game continues like this until one of the players is unable to name a movie or an actor.
* Failure to name a unique movie or an actor results in that player getting a letter (like the game HORSE, except we're spelling GHOST).

_Note_: Because you'll be playing against robots with a connection to a movie database,
you probably won't ever win. The object of the game then is to see how many rounds you can last. 

## Ideas for future development
* Create accounts for users so they can save their high scores
* multiplayer gameplay
* chat box for multiplayer gameplay
